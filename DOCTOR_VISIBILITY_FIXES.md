# Doctor Visibility Fixes - Medistar Hospital Management System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Endpoint Case Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `doctor/alldoctor` but backend route was `doctor/allDoctor`
**Fix**: Updated `Frontend/Scripts/doctor.js` line 42 to use correct case

### 2. Doctor Status Default Issue
**Problem**: New doctors were created with `status: false` by default, making them invisible to patients
**Fix**: 
- Updated `Backend/routers/doctor.router.js` to set `status: true` by default
- Updated `Backend/supabase-schema.sql` to set `DEFAULT TRUE` for status field

### 3. Improved Doctor Filtering
**Problem**: No way to filter only available doctors
**Fix**: Added new endpoints and methods:
- `GET /doctor/availableDoctors` - Get only approved and available doctors
- `GET /doctor/availableDoctors/:id` - Get available doctors by department
- Updated frontend to use available doctors by default

## New Features Added

### 1. Available Doctors Endpoint
```javascript
// Backend: GET /doctor/availableDoctors
// Returns only doctors with status: true AND is_available: true
```

### 2. Available Doctors by Department
```javascript
// Backend: GET /doctor/availableDoctors/:departmentId
// Returns available doctors filtered by department
```

### 3. Enhanced Doctor Model Methods
```javascript
// New methods in DoctorModel:
- findAvailable() - Get only available doctors
- findAvailableByDepartment(departmentId) - Get available doctors by department
```

### 4. Sample Data Script
```javascript
// Backend/add-sample-doctors.js
// Adds 5 sample doctors with different specializations
```

## Testing

### 1. Run Sample Data Script
```bash
cd Backend
node add-sample-doctors.js
```

### 2. Test Endpoints
```bash
cd Backend
node test-doctors.js
```

### 3. Manual Testing
1. Start the backend server: `npm start`
2. Open frontend in browser
3. Navigate to doctors page
4. Verify doctors are visible
5. Test department filtering
6. Test search functionality

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Doctors not visible due to API endpoint mismatch
- ❌ New doctors created with `status: false` (invisible)
- ❌ No way to filter only available doctors

### After Fixes
- ✅ Doctors immediately visible when added by admin
- ✅ Only approved and available doctors shown to patients
- ✅ Proper department filtering
- ✅ Better user experience with instant availability

## Database Migration

If you have existing data, you may need to update existing doctors:

```sql
-- Update existing doctors to be available
UPDATE doctors SET status = true, is_available = true WHERE status = false;
```

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/doctor/allDoctor` | GET | Get all doctors (admin use) |
| `/doctor/availableDoctors` | GET | Get only available doctors (patient use) |
| `/doctor/availableDoctors/:id` | GET | Get available doctors by department |
| `/doctor/allDoctor/:id` | GET | Get all doctors by department (admin use) |
| `/doctor/addDoctor` | POST | Add new doctor (instantly available) |
| `/doctor/updateDoctorStatus/:id` | PATCH | Update doctor approval status |
| `/doctor/isAvailable/:doctorId` | PATCH | Update doctor availability |

## Benefits

1. **Instant Availability**: Doctors are immediately available for booking when added
2. **Better Performance**: Backend filtering reduces frontend processing
3. **Improved UX**: Patients only see doctors they can actually book
4. **Consistent API**: Proper endpoint naming and structure
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more filtering options in the future
