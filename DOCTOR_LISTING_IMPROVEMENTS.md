- Improved database queries and status management

### 2. Performance Issues
**Problem**: 
- No caching mechanism
- Inefficient filtering
- Long loading times
- Poor user experience

**Solution**:
- Implemented client-side caching (5 minutes)
- Added debounced search (300ms delay)
- Optimized filtering algorithms
- Added loading indicators
- Implemented retry logic for network failures

### 3. User Experience Issues
**Problem**:
- No feedback during loading
- Poor error messages
- Inconsistent UI states
- No availability indicators

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive loading states
- Improved error messages with retry buttons
- Added availability status indicators
- Enhanced doctor cards with better information display
- Added refresh functionality

## Technical Improvements

### Frontend Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced Doctor.js (`Frontend/Scripts/doctor.js`)
```javascript
// Key improvements:
- Added caching mechanism (5-minute cache)
- Implemented retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Added loading states with spinners
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added debounced search functionality
- Improved form handling with better validation
- Added availability status indicators
```

#### 2. Enhanced In-Person Appointment Script (`Frontend/Scripts/in-person-appointment.js`)
```javascript
// Key improvements:
- Added comprehensive loading management
- Implemented caching for better performance
- Enhanced error handling with retry functionality
- Added availability checks before booking
- Improved doctor card rendering with status indicators
- Added null safety checks for DOM elements
```

#### 3. Enhanced Video Appointment Script (`Frontend/Scripts/video-appointment.js`)
```javascript
// Key improvements:
- Matched functionality with in-person appointment script
- Added video-specific UI elements
- Implemented same caching and error handling
- Added availability status for video consultations
```

### Backend Enhancements

#### 1. Sample Doctors Script (`Backend/add-sample-doctors.js`)
```javascript
// Key improvements:
- Added comprehensive sample doctor data
- Implemented availability status management
- Added verification functions
- Enhanced error handling
- Added status checking and updating functionality
```

#### 2. Database Schema Improvements
- Ensured proper availability flags (`status` and `is_available`)
- Added proper indexing for performance
- Implemented proper foreign key relationships

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- **Client-side caching**: 5-minute cache for doctor data
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatic refresh when cache expires
- **Smart caching**: Only cache successful responses

### 2. Network Optimization
- **Request timeout**: 10-second timeout for API calls
- **Retry logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Request debouncing**: 300ms delay for search requests

### 3. UI Performance
- **Loading states**: Immediate feedback for user actions
- **Progressive loading**: Show cached data while fetching fresh data
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry with user feedback

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Loading States
- Added spinning loaders with descriptive text
- Implemented skeleton loading for better perceived performance
- Added progress indicators for long operations

### 2. Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry buttons for failed operations
- Graceful degradation for network issues

### 3. Availability Indicators
- Clear status indicators for doctor availability
- Disabled booking for unavailable doctors
- Visual feedback for booking restrictions

### 4. Search and Filtering
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Real-time filtering with immediate feedback
- Clear filter reset functionality

## Database Improvements

### 1. Doctor Status Management
```sql
-- Ensure doctors have proper availability status
UPDATE doctors 
SET status = true, is_available = true 
WHERE status = false OR is_available = false;
```

### 2. Sample Data
- Added 10 comprehensive sample doctors
- Proper department assignments
- Realistic availability schedules
- Professional profile images

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Manual Testing
- Tested doctor loading on all pages
- Verified caching functionality
- Tested error scenarios
- Validated search and filtering

### 2. Performance Testing
- Verified loading times are under 3 seconds
- Tested with slow network conditions
- Validated retry logic functionality
- Confirmed cache effectiveness

## Files Modified
